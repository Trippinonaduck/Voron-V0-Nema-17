Mod to replace stock nema 14 motors with nema 17 motors

I had extra nema 17 motors and wanted a way to use them on the V0.  No new hardware is needed(other than motors)

You'll reprint the A and B Motor mounts, 6mm extrusion spacers, and new motor plate.

Spacers go in between the extrusions. The same mounting screws can be used for the blind joints.
